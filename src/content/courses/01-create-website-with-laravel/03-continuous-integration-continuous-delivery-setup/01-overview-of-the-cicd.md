# CI/CD Overview

After creating the Laravel Project on our local machine and creating the repository on GitHub the next thing I 
always do is to set up the **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment (CD)** processes.

CI involves automatically integrating code changes into a shared repository multiple times a day. 
This frequent integration helps identify issues early in the development process. With this processes
in place we want to ensure that all developers follow, for instance, the same code style, with automated tests and builds we want to make sure that
we catch errors, bugs, and compatibility issues quickly, reducing the chances of accumulating over time,
or bringing a change that will break our application, helping on the **Early Detection of Issues**.

Implementing this processes in the beginning of a new project is crucial to provide **Faster Feedback Loop**
to developers by running automated tests and checks with each code change. Your teammates will receive
immediate feedback on the impact of their changes, allowing them to address issues promptly.
